# A Greek youth ratio hexbin map

A hexbin map showing the ratio of the 15-29 age group to the total population in Greek municipal units. The lowest ratios (in darker colors) are found mostly in Epirus and the central Peloponnese; around 15% of the population in Athens, Thessaloniki and Patra consists of youths, whereas most yellow points (>20%) are found either in tourist areas (such as Rhodes) or in border regions - presumably due to military relocation.

Coded using D3.js and Python.

The original idea of the map (for Germany) belongs to Ansgar Wolsing.
